# Gitbash Dot Files

## Author

## Description

A bashrc and a bash_profile file that can be used to alter the look of the bash terminal. Also, is a minttyrc to alter the colors of the terminal

### Notes

The bashrc and bash_profile should work fine on linux systems as well. Linux terminals do not use mintty, so the minttyrc file will not work on there.

You are free to use, copy, and alter this as you see fit. These files were created with learning in mind, and are not subject to any copyright.
